## Integrate into Your GitHub Profile

To showcase the Pac-Man game on your GitHub profile, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Special Repository**:

    - Name a new repository exactly as your GitHub username (e.g., `username/username`).
    - This repository powers your GitHub profile page.

2. **Set Up GitHub Actions**:

    - In the repository, create a `.github/workflows/` directory.
    - Add a `main.yml` file with the following content:

        ```yaml
        name: generate pacman game

        on:
        schedule: # Run automatically every 24 hours
            - cron: "0 */24 * * *"
        workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering
        push: # Runs on every push to the main branch
            branches:
            - main

        jobs:
        generate:
            permissions:
            contents: write
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            timeout-minutes: 5

            steps:
            - name: generate pacman-contribution-graph.svg
                uses: abozanona/pacman-contribution-graph@main
                with:
                github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}

            # Push the generated SVG to the output branch
            - name: push pacman-contribution-graph.svg to the output branch
                uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v3.1.0
                with:
                target_branch: output
                build_dir: dist
                env:

1. **Create a Special Repository**:

    - Name a new repository exactly as your GitHub username (e.g., `username/username`).
    - This repository powers your GitHub profile page.

2. **Generate & Setup Push Token**:

    - Open the repository, and from left sidebar navigate to settings => Access Token tab.
    - Generate a new Access Token with the name `CI/CD Push Token` & scope `write_repository`. Access tokens are only valid for 1 year maximum.
    - From left sidebar navigate to settings => CI/CD.
    - In Variables section, add a new variable with the name `CI_PUSH_TOKEN` and the value of the Access Token. Make sure that the variable is `Masked` & `Protect`.

3. **Set Up `gitlab-ci` File**:

    - In the repository, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the following content.

        ```yaml
        stages:
            - generate
            - deploy

        variables:
            GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive

        generate_pacman_graph:
            stage: generate
            image: node:20
            script:
                - mkdir -p dist
                - npm install -g pacman-contribution-graph
                - pacman-contribution-graph --platform gitlab --username "$CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE" --gameTheme gitlab --output pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg
                - mv pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg dist/pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg
                - pacman-contribution-graph --platform gitlab --username "$CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE" --gameTheme gitlab-dark --output pacman-contribution-graph-dark.svg
                - mv pacman-contribution-graph-dark.svg dist/pacman-contribution-graph-dark.svg
            artifacts:
                paths:
                    - dist/pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg
                    - dist/pacman-contribution-graph-dark.svg
                expire_in: 1 hour
            rules:
                - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"'
                - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"'

        deploy_to_readme:
            stage: deploy
            image: alpine:latest
            script:
                - apk add --no-cache git
                - mkdir -p output
                - cp dist/pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg output/
                - cp dist/pacman-contribution-graph-dark.svg output/
                - git remote set-url origin https://gitlab-ci-token:${CI_PUSH_TOKEN}@gitlab.com/${CI_PROJECT_PATH}.git
                - git config --global user.email "pacman-bot@example.com"
                - git config --global user.name "Pacman Bot"
                - git add output/pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg output/pacman-contribution-graph-dark.svg
                - git commit -m "Update Pac-Man contribution graph [ci skip]" || echo "No changes"
                - git push origin HEAD:main
            rules:
                - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"'
                - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"'
        ```

4. **Add to Profile README**:

    - In your repository, create or edit the `README.md` file to include:

        ```markdown
        ## My Contribution Graph

        <picture>
            <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://gitlab.com/[USERNAME]/[USERNAME]/-/raw/main/output/pacman-contribution-graph-dark.svg">
            <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://gitlab.com/[USERNAME]/[USERNAME]/-/raw/main/output/pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg">
            <img alt="pacman contribution graph" src="https://gitlab.com/[USERNAME]/[USERNAME]/-/raw/main/output/pacman-contribution-graph-light.svg">
        </picture>
        ```

5. **Commit and Push**:

    - Push the changes to GitHub. The Gitlab pipeline will work once, updating the Pac-Man game on your profile.

6. **Schedule pipeline running**
    - Go to your project in GitLab
    - In the left sidebar, navigate to Build > Pipeline schedules (sometimes under CI/CD > Schedules)
    - Click New schedule
    - In the form:
        - Interval pattern: Enter a cron expression for daily runs. For example, `0 2 \* \* \*` to run every day at 2:00 AM (UTC).
        - Timezone: Select your preferred timezone.
        - Target branch: Choose the main branch.
    - Click Save pipeline schedule (or Create pipeline schedule).

Your pacman picture will now be generated automatically every day at the same time.

## ‚è≥ Run the Workflow Manually

Once you have everything set up:

- Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
- Click "Update Pac-Man Contribution"
- Click "Run workflow" > "Run workflow"

This will start the SVG generation process and you will then be able to see the animation working in your README!
This implementation will allow your Pac-Man contribution graph to be automatically updated every day, keeping it always up to date with your latest contributions.

## üéØ How it Works

The application uses your GitHub contribution data to:

1. Create a grid where each cell represents a day of contribution
2. Use the contribution intensity levels provided by the GitHub API:

- NONE: Days with no contributions (empty spaces in the game)
- FIRST_QUARTILE: Days with few contributions (small points, 1 point in the game)
- SECOND_QUARTILE: Days with moderate contributions (medium points, 2 points)
- THIRD_QUARTILE: Days with many contributions (large points, 5 points)
- FOURTH_QUARTILE: Days with exceptional contributions (power pellets that activate ghost-eating mode)

These levels are relative to each user's contribution pattern and are automatically calculated by GitHub, so the density of elements in the game will reflect each user's unique profile.

3. Pac-Man navigates the grid using pathfinding algorithms
4. Ghosts chase Pac-Man with unique behaviors (as in the original game)
5. All gameplay is recorded and exported as an animated SVG

## üëª Ghosts Personalities

Each ghost has been given new looks and personalities that are true to the original game.

|       Ghost        |                                        Preview                                        | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :----------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Blinky** (red)  |  <p align="center"><img src="assets/gifs/red_flip.gif" height="40" alt="Blinky"></p>  | An aggressive stalker who targets Pac-Man directly. He gets faster when there are only a few dots left on the map, which players call "Elroy mode".                          |
|  **Pinky** (pink)  |  <p align="center"><img src="assets/gifs/pink_flip.gif" height="40" alt="Pinky"></p>  | Strategist who tries to ambush Pac-Man by positioning himself 4 spaces ahead of his current direction. He specializes in traps and ambushes.                                 |
|  **Inky** (cyan)   |  <p align="center"><img src="assets/gifs/cyan_flip.gif" height="40" alt="Inky"></p>   | Unpredictable and complex. Uses Blinky's position as a reference for his movement, calculating a vector that passes through Pac-Man and then doubling that distance.         |
| **Clyde** (orange) | <p align="center"><img src="assets/gifs/orange_flip.gif" height="40" alt="Clyde"></p> | Shy and erratic. Chases Pac-Man when he is far away, but when he gets closer than 8 spaces away, he runs away to his corner. This "shy" behavior makes him less predictable. |
